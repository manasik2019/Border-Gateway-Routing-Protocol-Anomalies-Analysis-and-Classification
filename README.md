# Border-Gateway-Routing-Protocol-Anomalies-Analysis-and-Classification

Many internet anomalies have been detected over the past years of the internet age that caused 
massive inconsistency in BGP updates, and studying BGP behaviors during these 
anomalies will help in developing detection tools to ensure networksstability, confidential data exchange,
and the required quality of service for Internet operations.

This research studies datasets for five well-known internet anomalies  by presenting four levels of data analystics: 
- Descriptive Analysis
- Infernetial Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Deep Learning

BGP datasets for WannaCry, Moscow Blackout, Slammer, Nimda, and Code Red I are available at:
